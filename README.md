To create the VM i used venv module that comes with Python

# Activating the VM - Do this every time you start a new terminal session to work on project
    $ source .venv/bin/activate

# TIP
everytime you install a new package in the environment, activate the environment again. 
Ensures using CLI program installed by that package uses the one from VM, not globally. 

# Checking if VM active
which python

/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin/python - WORKING!


# Upgrade PIP - not using uv might transition tho
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Add gitignore
$echo "*" > .venv/.gitignore

# Install packages directly
if youre in a hurry and dont want to use a file to declare your package requirements, install directly

pip install "fastapi[standard]"

# TIP

Its a very good idea to put the packages and versions your program needs in a file (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)


# Install from requirements.txt
if you have one you can use it to install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# deactivate VM
$ deactivate

#COnfigure editor

# start the live server

fastapi dev main.py


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
